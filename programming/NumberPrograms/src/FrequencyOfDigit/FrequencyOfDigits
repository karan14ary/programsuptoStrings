steps for execution for frequency of digit
step 1 : Take the user input for number as integer
step 2 :Take an empty array
step 3 :Take each digit of the number using while loop until n is not equal to 0
step 4 :Increase the count of digit when ever it get the same digit
step 5 :take for loop for an array from index value to to it's length
step 6 : assign array of index value  0 to array length
step 7 :Check for the value is not equal to 0
step 8 : print the non zero  value of the array along with the digit frequency

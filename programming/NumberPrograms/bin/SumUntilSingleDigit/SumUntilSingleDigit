steps for executing the sum of digit until single digit
step 1 : Take user input from the user as n
step 2 :check until a number is greater than 10 using while loop
step 3 :take nested while loop for each digit until n is not equal to 0
step 4 :take the each digit/remeinder and store it in r using n%10
step 4 : take the sum of digits 
step 5 : assign number with sum so the sum value will go in loop if greater than equal to 10 
step 6 : print the sum of digits until the value of sum is single digit

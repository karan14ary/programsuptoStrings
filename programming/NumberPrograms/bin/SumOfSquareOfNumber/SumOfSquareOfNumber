step for executioin of sum of square of number from 1 to n
Step 1 :Take the user input n
step 2 :Take iternation using for loop from i=1 to i<=n
step 3 :take the square of each number using i*i and store it in int s variable 
step 4 :take the sum of the square number using squaresum=squaresum+s where squaresum is initialized as 0
step 5 :Print squaresum sum of square from 1 to n
